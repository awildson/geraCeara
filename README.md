# geraCeara

The basic goal this code is get roadway from OpenStreetMap and generate the a undirected graph with cities and your links.

The path to get this is:
1) get data from OSM
2) generate the Graph (nodes, edges)
3) remove nodes not necessary (chage more links into a link beteween two cities and connection roadmaps)
4) conect the subgraph (the OSM data can get errors of the connectivity into graph)
